## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project enables a fitbit consumer to change their watch face interface to a select anime theme that will work on a FitBit Ionic. The FitBit would still have its core functionallity. The theme would include the display of the time, date, background and anime emojis. This plugin will engage the consumer while giving them the ability to reach their fitness goals with an everchanging watch face background based on their personal achievements. When you reach certain milestones you will have a friendly anime emoji appear to either congratulate you on your achievement or encourage you to keep going.

These enhanceded features will keep the user engaged and lead them to completing their daily fitness goal in a fun an interactive way while having a theme downloaded to thier FitBit that fits the users personaility. 

The idea came from me purchasing a Fibit and not having a downloadeable theme that fits my personality.
